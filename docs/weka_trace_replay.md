# Weka Trace Replay

The Weka Trace Replay capability allows you to benchmark GenAI model servers by replaying complex, real-world multi-agent execution traces. It converts a raw trace into a **dependency graph of events** (parent-child turns, tool calls, subagent spawns) and replays it concurrently, maintaining full causal/dependency fidelity.

## 🏗️ How it Works

1. **Dataset Download**: At startup, `inference-perf` downloads the Weka trace dataset from Hugging Face (e.g. `semianalysisai/cc-traces-weka-with-subagents-060826-256k`).
2. **Graph Compilation**: The replay generator parses each trace session, compiling individual turns and events into an **Execution Graph** of nodes. Each node represents an event (an inference call or tool/subagent execution).
3. **Causal Propagation**: Nodes register parent-child relationships. The text output of parent nodes is dynamically cached and substituted into the prompt messages of child nodes at runtime (e.g. tool execution output is placed back in the next LLM call).
4. **Session-based Execution**: A thread pool runs sessions concurrently. Within each session, nodes are executed as soon as their parents complete.
5. **Think-Time Simulation**: Think times and idle gaps between turns are simulated and capped using `trace_idle_gap_cap_seconds`.

api:
  type: chat
  streaming: true

server:
  type: mock # or openai/vllm/sglang/tgi

tokenizer:
  pretrained_model_name_or_path: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct

data:
  type: weka_trace_replay
  weka_trace_replay:
    hf_dataset_path: "semianalysisai/cc-traces-weka-with-subagents-060826-256k"

## 🏃 Running the Benchmark

Run the benchmark with the following command:

```bash
python3 inference_perf/main.py -c configs/weka_trace_replay.yaml
```

The execution results will be written to the `reports-...` directory and summarized in [benchmark-results.md](../benchmark-results.md).
